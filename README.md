# Minecraft-Datapack-One-heart-survival


So, i made 1HP datapack for minecraft....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This datapack took like 5 minutes to make. I don't know why, but i just made it for fun.
Functions in my datapack forces player's health to be at value 2. (1 Heart)
My functions in datapack files also force disables effect minecraft:health_boost.
(You cannot edit player's health until you edit the datapack's function's. All commands are in tick, and load.)
